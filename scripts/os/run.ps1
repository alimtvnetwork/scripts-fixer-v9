.SYNOPSIS
    OS subcommand dispatcher. Routes 'os <action>' to the right helper.

.DESCRIPTION
    Static actions: clean, temp-clean, hib-off/on, flp, add-user, help.
    Dynamic actions: every clean-<name> resolves to clean-categories\<name>.ps1
    (36 categories, see `os --help`).

.EXAMPLES
    .\run.ps1 os clean
    .\run.ps1 os clean --dry-run
    .\run.ps1 os clean --bucket D
    .\run.ps1 os clean --skip recycle,ms-search
    .\run.ps1 os clean-chrome
    .\run.ps1 os clean-recycle --yes
    .\run.ps1 os clean-obs-recordings --days 7 --dry-run
